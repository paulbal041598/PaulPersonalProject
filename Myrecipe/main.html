            <p class="font">Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo. </p>

            <h1>Adobo History</h1>
            <p class="font">The Spanish word adobar means “to marinate,” and this is actually where we got the name of this dish. The marinade can be in the form of a liquid one or rubbed using a combination of powdered ingredients. This Filipino Adobo, as I mentioned earlier, suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. And if you would like, vinegar is something you can add as a marinade ingredient.</p>
            <img class="step-procedure" src="https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Filipino-pork-adobo-in-a-bowl.jpg" alt="adobo">
            <p class="font">But did you know that the very dish we probably see on our dinner tables almost on a daily basis can be traced all the way back to the 1600s? The first documented recipe was found in a dictionary from 1613 where it was called “adobo de los naturales.” </p>
            <p class="font">Mexican adobo, on the other hand, makes use of chilis, garlic, cinnamon, and oregano as marinade. Both dishes look and taste different. It will be unfair to compare which among the two dishes are best because each of us has our own preference when it comes to flavor. But what I can tell you is that both are surely worth a try!</p>

                – This is one of the favorite when it comes to family picnics. This is a dish wherein pork and chicken slices are combined and cooked inadobo style. It can be done the same way as this recipe, with or without onions. This is our clans signature summer dish in the Philippines. I remember my tito’s and tita’s prepare a large portion every summer outing. We would go to Pansol in Laguna to rent a swimming pool for the clan and they would bring with them two large cauldrons (kaldero). One has the adobo in it, while the other is for the rice.

                 – Classic! This is notorious for making people on limited-rice-diet crave for more rice. It is very rich, tasty, and delicious. Add a few pieces of Thai chili pepper, and you will not get enough of it.

                <h1>Notes: </h1>
                <ol class="font num-marg">
                    <li><bold>Pork belly –</bold>This is the most common cut of pork to use for adobo, but you can also use other cuts as long as it has some fat content. Fat makes the meat moist. I suggest using pork shoulder as an alternative cut.</li><br>
                    <li><bold>Garlic –</bold>Filipino adobo won’t be the same without garlic. The more garlic I use, the better my adobo is (in my opinion). Crush the garlic using a mortar and pestle tool or the side of your knife before cooking. This ensures that the flavors are quickly extracted from it.</li><br>
                    <li><bold>Dried bay leaves – </bold>Bay leaves or Laurel leaves is a must for this recipe. Dried bay leaves are the most commonly used due to its availability. Fresh bay leaves is good too.</li><br>
                    <li><bold>White vinegar –</bold>If this is not available, either cane or rice vinegar can be used as substitutes.</li><br>
                    <li><bold>Soy sauce – </bold> I use Filipino brand soy sauce all the time. In my opinion, using other kinds of soy sauce affects the authentic flavor of the dish.</li><br>
                    <li><bold>Peppercorn –</bold>Whole peppercorns are ideal. However, you can use cracked pepper or ground pepper for this recipe.</li><br>
                    <li><bold>Onion –</bold>This recipe does not suggest the use of onion. But I think that onions help improve the taste of adobo. Use red, yellow, or white onion for this recipe, but make sure to chop it into small pieces!</li><br>
                    <li><bold>Sugar – </bold>Adding a teaspoon of sugar will move your Pork Adobo towards the sweeter side. I personally love the taste of adobo with a bit of sugar!</li><br>
                </ol>
                <h1>Alternative and Additional Ingredients:</h1>
                <p class="font"><bold>Pork - </bold>Use any cut of pork that you prefer. I suggest pork belly for best results. However, use leaner parts if you are trying to avoid fats. Pork tenderloin is a healthier choice. This is very tender and contains way less fat than pork belly. You can also use other proteins such as chicken and goat meat using this recipe.</p>
                <p class="font"><bold>Onion - </bold>This recipe does not suggest the use of onion. I think that onions help improve the taste of adobo. Use red, yellow, or white onion for this recipe. Make sure to chop it into small pieces.</p>
                <p class="font"><bold>Dried Bay Leaves - </bold>this is an ingredient that you can almost always find most of the time in the spice section of your local supermarket. Believe it or not, but this makes a huge difference when cooking adobo.</p>
                <p class="font"><bold>Whole Peppercorn - </bold>this is a traditional ingredient. It will not matter if you use crushed peppercorn or ground black pepper. Sichuan peppercorns are also good alternatives.</p>
                <p class="font"><bold>Sugar</bold> adding a teaspoon of sugar will move your pork adobo on the sweeter side. I personally love the taste of adobo with a bit of sugar.</p><br>
